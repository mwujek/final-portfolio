				<p>Revolver Yoga is an esteemed local business in my hometown, Walla Walla, WA. Owner and instructor, Courtney Morgan, asked me to design an elegant website that would ultimately increase online bookings through thoughtfully tailored UX design. Here’s what Courtney has to say about the site:</p>
				<div class="quote-block">

					<p class="quote">“What an absolute pleasure it has been to work with Matt and see the amazing website for my business come together quickly and without any stress (on my end, at least). It has been so easy to collaborate with him, to tell him my needs, ideas, vision, and how my clients need the site to function to get them into the door. Matt's ability to integrate not only a super functional blog interface but also, and most importantly, our external booking site for classes and workshops has made the transition from curiosity to client commitment so much simpler. His clean, edited, and stylish design aesthetic has proven time and again to impress potential clients and bring them into the studio.</p>

					<p class="quote">Working with Matt has been a match from day one, and I couldn't be happier. I highly recommend him to any of my friends, clients, or business connections who are looking for a designer who genuinely cares about his work; from the initial steps of creating the concept, communication, and ideal personalized functionality to a clear aesthetic that represents their branding. Matt will be my designer for as long as he will take on my projects!”</p>
